In progress
-----------

* the static view should be secured too
  this will be fixed in next pyramid release, see:
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/161

* upgrade galleria to 1.2 (git submodule)
  we should create a pygall plugin for galleria similar to the flickr plugin

* remove gp.fileupload on server side, and make use of
  https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload on client side.
  See also: http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscookbook/A+Better+Way+To+Limit+File+Upload+Size
  and: http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/gd9s8/uploading_files_with_pyramid/

* add a custom formalchemy renderer for a pygall image (which should handle the
  scaled image, and the custom url, md5sum...)
