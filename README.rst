About PyGall
------------

PyGall is a simple web photo gallery written in Python and built on the
`Pyramid <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/docs/pyramid.html>`_ web framework.

PyGall is licensed under a BSD permissive license.

Code is hosted on github: https://github.com/inneos/PyGall.

Be warned that this image gallery is beta software, and not full featured.
It has been developped to fit my own needs, and may not suit your wishes.

But that being said, feel free to report bugs or ask for new features at
https://github.com/inneos/PyGall/issues.
Even better, since the code is hosted on github, feel free to fork and send
pull requests.

Features
--------

PyGall currently provides the following features:

* Browse and view photos through a nice interface borrowed from
  `Galleria <http://galleria.aino.se/>`_.

* Bulk upload of photos through the browser using `jQuery-File-Upload
  <https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload>`_. The photos are
  automatically scaled and rotated if needed.

* If using `F-Spot <http://f-spot.org/>`_ as your personal photo management
  desktop application, PyGall provides a script to automatically import photos
  from F-Spot and keep in sync your PyGall gallery.

* Administer your PyGall gallery via a dedicated interface that let you update
  photo metadata such as date, rating, or description. You can also delete
  photos, or organize them through tags (which will soon be used to provide
  different views in PyGall).

Install
-------

Prior to actually install PyGall and its dependencies, you should install the
libjpeg and python development files, which are needed to compile the Python
Imaging Library dependency.
On Debian Linux you can do::

    $ sudo aptitude install build-essential libjpeg-dev python-dev

You should have a working setuptools (or distribute) environment. I advise
you to use `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to create
an isolated Python environment.
On Linux you can do::

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/pypa/virtualenv/master/virtualenv.py 
    $ python virtualenv.py --no-site-packages venv

This will create a virtual environment named `venv` that we'll use to install
PyGall. See http://www.virtualenv.org for more information on virtualenv.

So let's install PyGall in the freshly created venv::

    $ venv/bin/pip install PyGall

PyGall is now installed. We need to make a configuration file for your
PyGall photo gallery. The easiest way is to copy the file from the PyGall
repository and customize it to your needs::

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/inneos/PyGall/master/production.ini

First, you should edit ``production.ini`` and set a unique random value for
the ``authtkt_secret`` (instead of the `Ì€ changeme`` default value) to guard
against the theft of authentication session.

This ``production.ini`` file will be used by Paster to initialize the
application, create the database, and serve your application.

So you need to setup PyGall, generate a configuration for
authentication (auth.cfg) and create the database (PyGall.db)::

    $ venv/bin/python -m pygall.scripts.setup production.ini

And finally, you can serve your PyGall application::

    $ venv/bin/paster serve production.ini

That's all, you can point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:6543 and start
using PyGall.

By default, the following 2 user accounts are set up:

An administrator account
  | login: admin
  | password: admin

A guest account
  | login: guest
  | password: guest

.. note::

    You can edit these users by editing the auth.cfg file located in the same
    directory as your production.ini file. Note that password hashes are
    generated using the htpasswd utility. For example, to add a user named
    "john", you will generate his password hash with::

        $ htpasswd -n john

    Then you just have to append a new line to the file auth.cfg copying the
    output of the previous htpasswd command.

    If john should be in group admin, then just append ":admin" to the line.

    Also remember to change the passwords of the default accounts (or remove
    these default accounts entirely).

Log in as administrator and you're ready to import your first photos!

Use PyGall
----------

When anonymous, you will be prompted for login. Only users logged in will be
allowed to view the gallery.

So once logged in, you will be redirected to the PyGall index page and you will
be able to view photos.
Then if you are part of the admin group, you will be allowed both to upload new
photos and to edit, delete existing photos. For that purpose, you can click on
the 'Upload' and 'Admin' link in the upper right corner of the gallery.

If you are using F-spot as your personnal photo management desktop application,
you can rather choose to use the F-spot synchronization script provided with
PyGall to import photos coming from F-spot directly in your gallery.
To use it, simply run the following command::

   $ venv/bin/python -m pygall.scripts.fspot_sync --fspot-photosdir=/path/to/fspot/photos production.ini

By default, all photos that have the tag 'pygall' will be imported in your
gallery. Pass `--help` option to see all possible options::

   $ venv/bin/python -m pygall.scripts.fspot_sync --help

When your gallery is full of photos, and once you have created new user
accounts (please refer to the previous section note to learn how to create new
accounts), you are now able to share it with friends and family.
