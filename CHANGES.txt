Changes
=======

0.9
---

* build an administration interface based on FormAlchemy

* complete rewriting of the script that do the synchronization from f-spot

* refactor and clean up the imageprocessing module so that it can be used by
  the f-spot sync script

* image md5sum does not take the exif metadata into account so that when a tag
  is added or removed, the md5sum does not change anymore

* add fspot_id to the PyGallPhoto model so that we are able to track photos
  that have been imported from F-spot

* remove upper limit on SQLAlchemy dependency, so that PyGall can be used with
  SQLAlchemy 0.7

* the static view is now also secured

* upload is now much better (based on jQuery-File-Upload instead of
  gp.fileupload)

0.8
---

* port PyGall to the pyramid web framework
  http://pylonsproject.org/

0.7
---

* add support for other image formats than jpeg (these formats should be
